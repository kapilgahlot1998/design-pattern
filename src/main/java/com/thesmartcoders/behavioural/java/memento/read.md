The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that captures the internal state of an object without exposing its details and allows the object to be restored to that state later. It's used to provide the ability to undo or revert an object's state to a previous point in time. The pattern is especially useful when you need to implement undo functionality or maintain a history of an object's states.

**When to Use the Memento Pattern:**

1. **Undo and Redo:** When you want to enable users to undo or redo actions in an application, the Memento Pattern can help you store and restore object states.

2. **Snapshotting:** When you need to capture and restore an object's state in a way that isolates the state from the rest of the system.

3. **Versioning:** When you want to maintain a history of an object's changes or versions, allowing you to roll back to previous states.

4. **Caching:** When you need to implement caching mechanisms that store object states for optimization purposes.

**Pros of Using the Memento Pattern:**

1. **State Isolation:** The pattern ensures that the internal state of an object is encapsulated and not exposed directly, promoting better encapsulation and information hiding.

2. **Undo and Redo:** It provides an elegant way to implement undo and redo functionality in applications.

3. **Versioning and History:** The pattern allows you to track and manage object state history for versioning and auditing purposes.

4. **Flexibility:** The pattern allows you to save and restore object states at arbitrary points in time, offering great flexibility.

**Cons and Limitations of Using the Memento Pattern:**

1. **Memory Overhead:** Storing multiple snapshots of an object's state can lead to increased memory consumption, especially if the object has a large state.

2. **Performance:** Saving and restoring states can introduce overhead, particularly if the state is complex or requires deep copying.

3. **Coping with State Changes:** The pattern might become more complex to manage if the object's state contains references to other objects that also need to be considered during restoration.

4. **Dependency on Originator:** The Memento Pattern requires a close relationship between the originator (object whose state is being saved) and the memento (object storing the state). This might introduce tight coupling.

5. **Immutability and Large State:** If the object's state is mutable and large, copying the state for snapshots might be inefficient.
