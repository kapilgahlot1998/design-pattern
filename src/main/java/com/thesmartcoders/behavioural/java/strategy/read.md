The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them into separate classes, and make them interchangeable. This pattern enables you to select an algorithm at runtime based on the context, promoting flexibility, and enabling dynamic behavior changes.

**Use of the Strategy Design Pattern:**

1. **Variability in Algorithms:** When you have multiple algorithms that can be used interchangeably to achieve a specific goal. For example, sorting algorithms, payment methods, or file compression strategies.

2. **Avoiding Conditional Statements:** Instead of using complex conditional statements to choose among different algorithms, the Strategy Pattern lets you encapsulate each algorithm in a separate class, improving code maintainability.

3. **Runtime Algorithm Selection:** When you need to select an algorithm dynamically at runtime. This can be useful in situations where the choice of algorithm depends on user input, configuration, or other external factors.

**Applicability:**

- Use the Strategy Pattern when you want to define a family of related algorithms and make them interchangeable.
- Use it when you have multiple classes that differ in behavior but share a common interface.
- Use it to avoid tight coupling between the context and the algorithms, promoting better code organization and maintainability.

**Pros of the Strategy Design Pattern:**

1. **Flexibility:** You can easily swap algorithms without modifying the context class, enhancing the application's adaptability to changes.

2. **Modularity:** Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, leading to cleaner code and improved maintainability.

3. **Testability:** Algorithms can be tested independently, simplifying the testing process.

4. **Readability:** The pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the code easier to understand.

5. **Reusable:** New algorithms can be added without altering existing code, making the pattern highly reusable.

**Cons of the Strategy Design Pattern:**

1. **Increased Number of Classes:** Implementing the pattern might lead to a larger number of classes in your codebase, which can sometimes increase complexity.

2. **Overhead:** There might be some overhead due to the delegation between the context and the strategy classes.

3. **Complexity for Small Applications:** In simple applications with only a few algorithms, the added structure might not be necessary and can lead to unnecessary complexity.

**Example:**

Imagine a payment processing system where you have different payment methods: Credit Card, PayPal, and Google Pay. Instead of hardcoding the payment logic into a single class, you can use the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate each payment method in a separate strategy class. This allows you to dynamically select the appropriate payment method based on user preferences or other factors.
