The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that promotes loose coupling by centralizing communication between multiple objects. It introduces a mediator object that controls the interactions between various components, thereby reducing direct connections and dependencies among them. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where complex interactions between objects need to be managed effectively.

**When to Use the Mediator Pattern:**

1. **Complex Interactions:** When you have a set of objects that need to communicate with each other in complex ways, using a mediator can simplify and organize these interactions.

2. **Reducing Coupling:** When you want to reduce direct dependencies between components, making the codebase more maintainable and adaptable to changes.

3. **Centralized Control:** When you want to avoid having multiple objects communicate directly, and instead have a centralized controller (the mediator) manage these interactions.

4. **Event Handling:** When you need to handle events and communication between objects, the mediator can act as an event dispatcher.

**Pros of Using the Mediator Pattern:**

1. **Decoupling:** The Mediator Pattern reduces direct connections between components, leading to a more maintainable and flexible codebase.

2. **Centralized Logic:** Complex interaction logic is concentrated in a single mediator class, making it easier to manage and modify.

3. **Code Reusability:** By abstracting communication between objects, you can reuse the same mediator for different sets of components.

4. **Scalability:** Adding new components or changing interactions is less complex, as the mediator manages the coordination.

**Cons and Limitations of the Mediator Pattern:**

1. **Complexity:** The mediator can become complex if it's responsible for managing too many interactions and components.

2. **Single Point of Failure:** Since the mediator centralizes communication, if it fails, the entire communication process can be affected.

3. **Increased Indirection:** While the pattern reduces direct dependencies, it introduces an additional level of indirection, which might affect performance.

4. **Maintenance:** As the application grows, the mediator's responsibilities can become overwhelming, leading to maintenance challenges.

**Example:**

Imagine an air traffic control system where various aircraft need to communicate and coordinate their movements. Instead of every aircraft communicating directly with every other aircraft, a central air traffic control mediator manages the communication, ensuring safe and coordinated flight paths.
