The Visitor Design Pattern is used to separate the structure of an object from the operations that can be performed on it. It allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. The pattern is particularly useful when you have a complex hierarchy of objects and you want to perform various operations on them without changing their classes. Here's a breakdown of its use, applicability, and pros/cons:

**When to Use:**

1. **Complex Object Structures:** Use the Visitor Pattern when you have a complex object structure (e.g., composite, hierarchical) that contains different types of elements and you want to perform operations on these elements.

2. **New Operations:** If you anticipate adding new operations frequently and you don't want to modify existing classes each time you add an operation, the Visitor Pattern is suitable.

3. **Single Responsibility Principle:** The pattern promotes the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping each operation encapsulated in its own visitor class.

4. **Open/Closed Principle:** If you want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, the Visitor Pattern helps achieve this.

**Applicability:**

1. When you need to perform multiple unrelated operations on objects without modifying their classes.
2. When you have a complex object structure and you want to avoid adding new methods to its classes.
3. When you have many classes with differing interfaces and you want to avoid complex conditional statements.

**Pros:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Operations are encapsulated in separate visitor classes, promoting cleaner code organization.
2. **Extensibility:** Adding new operations is easier, as you only need to create a new visitor class without modifying existing elements.
3. **Open/Closed Principle:** The pattern adheres to the principle of being open for extension and closed for modification.
4. **Single Responsibility:** Each visitor class has a single responsibility, promoting the Single Responsibility Principle.
5. **Consistent Interface:** Visitor provides a consistent interface to perform operations on different types of elements.

**Cons:**

1. **Increased Complexity:** The pattern introduces additional classes, which can make the codebase more complex.
2. **Modification of Elements:** If new elements are added frequently, they need to be modified to accept new visitors, which might violate the open/closed principle.
3. **Runtime Overhead:** The pattern involves dynamic dispatch, which can lead to runtime overhead.
