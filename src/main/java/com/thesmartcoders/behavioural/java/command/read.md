The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that decouples the sender of a request (client) from the object that performs the action (receiver). It encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests. This pattern provides a way to implement operations, requests, or tasks in a flexible and extensible manner.

**When to Use:**

1. **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Command pattern is useful when you need to implement undo and redo functionality, as each command object can store the necessary information to reverse its action.

2. **Queueing and Logging:** When you want to queue requests, prioritize them, or log them for auditing purposes, the Command pattern allows you to manage these operations easily.

3. **Asynchronous Operations:** If you need to perform operations asynchronously, the Command pattern can encapsulate an action and its parameters, making it easy to manage asynchronous tasks.

4. **Remote Control Systems:** Command pattern is suitable for remote control systems, where you can send command objects over a network to perform actions on remote objects.

5. **GUI Controls:** In graphical user interfaces, command objects can encapsulate actions triggered by GUI controls (buttons, menu items), providing a way to manage user interactions.

**Applicability:**

- When you want to parameterize objects with operations.
- When you want to queue requests or implement undo/redo functionality.
- When you need to support different levels of abstraction for an action.
- When you want to separate the sender (client) from the receiver (performer of the action).

**Pros:**

1. **Decoupling:** Command pattern decouples the sender from the receiver, reducing dependencies between components.
2. **Flexibility:** You can easily add new commands without modifying existing code, promoting extensibility.
3. **Undo/Redo Support:** The pattern provides a natural way to implement undo and redo functionality.
4. **Queueing and Logging:** Commands can be queued, prioritized, and logged, enhancing control over execution.
5. **Asynchronous Operations:** The pattern can facilitate the execution of commands in separate threads or asynchronously.

**Cons:**

1. **Complexity:** Implementing command objects for every action can lead to a large number of classes and complexity.
2. **Increased Memory Usage:** Storing command objects and their parameters can increase memory usage.
3. **Overhead:** The pattern introduces additional overhead due to the need to create and manage command objects.
